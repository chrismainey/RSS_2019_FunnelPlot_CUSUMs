This repository contains the slides, a couple of scripts used for my talk at the Royal Statistical Society Conference 2019, on 5th September 2019.

I did want to share more, but I can't share patient data, nor anything that is UH intellectual properly.  Instead, we will use the Medicare dataset `medpar` in the `COUNT` package see [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COUNT/index.html) entry.
